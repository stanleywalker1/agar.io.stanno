About
This is my take on the classic agar.io game from my middle school era. This project is open source with code avalible on my portolio site. All the automated movement is derived from perlin noise. Built for Interactive Computing at NYU w/ Professor Kapp. Sound effects produced by @ha.hahao.

I adapted this partly from daniel shiffman coding challege #32. Built with p5.js.
